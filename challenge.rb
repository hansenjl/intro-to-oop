# Build your own person class
# A person should have a name, a hobby, and a hometown
# The hometown will not be changeable
# Create an instance method called #greeting that will introduce a person and print out both the name and hometown
# Create a class method to keep track of all of the people
# Create a class method to find all of the people from a certain hometown
